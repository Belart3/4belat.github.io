                     <i>2008-2011: Early years</i>
                     <p>In 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University, where they were both students.
                     Reynolds and Tolman recruited Andrew Beck, Dave Lemke, and Aurora Florence to play guitar, bass, and piano respectively for their band.
                     Their name is an anagram for a phrase only known to members of the group, that Reynolds stated each member approved of
                     .The five-piece released an extended play titled Speak to Me that year, but Beck and Florence departed from the band's line-up later that year. 
                     In 2009, Tolman recruited long-time high school friend Wayne Sermon, who had graduated from Berklee College of Music to play guitar.</p> 
                     <p>Tolman later recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman, to sing back-up and play keys, and the band began to play shows together again. 
                     Lemke left the band later on, leading Sermon to recruit another Berklee music student, Ben McKee, to join the band as their bassist and complete the line-up.
                     The band garnered a large following in their hometown of Provo, Utah, before the members moved to Las Vegas, the hometown of Dan Reynolds, where the band recorded and released their first three EPs.</p>

                     >
                     <p>The band released a self-titled EP Imagine Dragons on September 1, 2009, and Hell and Silence on March 10, 2010, both recorded at Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas.
                      Six months after releasing their third EP, It's Time on March 12, 2011, they signed a record deal with Interscope Records on 18 November 2011.</p>
                     <p>They got their first big break when Train's frontman Pat Monahan fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival 2009. Imagine Dragons were called to fill in and performed to a crowd of more than 26,000 people.
                     Local accolades including "Best CD of 2011" (Vegas SEVEN),"Best Local Indie Band 2010" (Las Vegas Weekly), "Las Vegas' Newest Must See Live Act" (Las Vegas CityLife), Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010, and more sent the band on a positive trajectory.
                     In November 2011 they signed with Interscope Records and began working with English Grammy Award-winning producer Alex da Kclass. Eventually the Tolmans left the group and Daniel Platzman was recruited in August 2011 by invitation from Ben McKee,
                      prior to the signing of the band's label deal in November 2011, alongsclasse keyboardist Theresa Flaminio.</p><br>
